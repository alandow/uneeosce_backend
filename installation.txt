To install UNE eOSCE backend:

1) copy all files into a webserver that
- runs php 5.3 or higher
- has GD and crypto libraries installed
- has ffmpeg binaries installed (if uploading video)

2) create a database, populate using eOSCE_database.sql
3) Rename config.inc.example.php to config.inc.php and modify to suit
4) In the 'users' table, change the password for the user 'admin' to the md5 hash of $CFG->password_salt+some password. eg if you want the password to be 'password' and $CFG->password_salt in config.inc.php is 'salt' then the password stored in the database should be the md5 hash of 'saltpassword'. In php: md5($CFG->password_salt . $password);
Alternately if you have integrated into LDAP/Active Directory then change the 'admin' username field to a valid username, the type to 'ad' and set the password to null.
